  Insights into media sentiment can reflect public and investor confidence, crucial for informed business and policy decisions.

  Localized economic sentiment can highlight how different groups are impacted by national and global economic events.

  Sentiment analysis on governance-related articles offers a lens into institutional trust and transparency.
